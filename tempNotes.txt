To Do:
- Finish the process that gets a Sheet into the JSON we need
- Fix the multiselect in form.html
- Code the method of transfer info from form.html -> blackbox.js
    - Give the site a URL (Put it online)
- Test blackbox.js
- Code the method of transfer info from blackbox.js -> results.html


    - Modify blackbox.js to switch the page from loadingScreen.html to results.html when finished searching (At least load for half a second)
        - Make it also change elements in results.html to display results



Organizing the flow of the tool:

Step 0:
    Turn sheets into .csv
    Convert CSV to JSON
    Convert JSON into more readable JSON w/ arrays

Step 1:
    Run form.html and let user input data
    Have code that transfers the informationt to blackbox.js
    
Step 2:
    Run loadScreen.html while blackbox.js searches/matches
    Run blackbox.js
        Read in vc-match.json
    
Step 3:
    Send the results from blackbox.js to results.html using another js file
